test-def: When I drag the element <<elementLocator>> at position <<elementPosition>> 3

    description = <<
        Case 3: Both elements are out of view. Scrolling the draggable element into view and the droppable element is still out of view.
        This case works only on Chrome broser.
    >>

    step: Given the page at url <<{{URL}}/dragdrop.html>> is open
    step: When I drag the element <<#draggable>> at position <<10,802>>
    step: Then the text of element <<#droppable>> should be <<Dropped!>>
